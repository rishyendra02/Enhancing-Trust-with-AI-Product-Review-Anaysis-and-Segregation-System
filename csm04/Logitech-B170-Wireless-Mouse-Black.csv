A Concise Appraisal for Discerning Consumers","I procured the Logitech B170 Wireless Mouse, boasting a 2.4 GHz connectivity and USB Nano Receiver, approximately 1.5 years ago. My ongoing utilization of this peripheral has furnished me with a comprehensive perspective that I deem imperative to share with prospective buyers.Undoubtedly, the Logitech B170 exhibits commendable optical tracking capabilities, characterized by superior sensitivity and seamless functionality. The smooth operationality, coupled with an aesthetically pleasing texture, renders it a sophisticated peripheral in the realm of wireless mice. Furthermore, its featherlight construction enhances portability, making it a convenient accessory for individuals on the move.However, it is crucial to underscore a salient consideration for potential buyers ‚Äî the Logitech B170 is diminutive in size. For users with larger palms, the ergonomic design may pose challenges, resulting in a potentially laborious user experience. Thus, I strongly advocate for a discerning evaluation of one's palm dimensions before contemplating the acquisition of this wireless mouse.Despite the ergonomic constraints, the Logitech B170 caters admirably to individuals with smaller palms. Its ergonomic design is tailored for optimal comfort and control in such scenarios. For those with petite hands, the Logitech B170 emerges as a commendable choice, offering a compelling amalgamation of functionality, aesthetics, and portability.",OR,Positive

Small, not too heavy, good looking.","Hi guys! Bought this yesterday, so haven‚Äôt used it much, so an early review. But the most detailed review so please read till the end. Very important points are mentioned.Looks are cute! It looks really nice and elegant. I am using it with a MacBook Air. So far it seems there are no problems using it. The scrolling is smooth, connection does not drop, and there is no lag. Connection is instant. There is no pairing required. It's plug and play along with the dongle provided with it.It sits low on the table, feels weighty but not in a wrong way. The battery adds to it's weight, but I have used heavier mice before, and this one feels just right. It has good grip. Nothing to complain about that.Buttons are nice and clicks are satisfactory, not too noisy; they are just right. Scroll wheel doesn't feel cheap at all, though I believe it could've been better quality. Body is matt finish and doesn't leave fingerprints on it, though if you're someone who eats and handles the mouse, then it'll show the oil prints and that's true with any peripherals. The mouse doesn't feel cheap overall, but it is definitely plasticky, though not in the bad sense. It is definitely not cheap looks wise.There is an on, off switch on the bottom which is helpful in saving the battery (which is included) when the mouse is not in use. There is no light on the bottom which is good if you have kids in the house who keep flipping the mouse and staring at the super bright light. So that's a good thing and a definite plus! The overall shape and size works in the favour of the mouse, and a variety of users with small and large palms will be satisfied with it.Now over to a major flaw. The mouse connects only though it's own usb dongle (which by the way comes tucked inside the body of the mouse itself, inside the battery door, which I found mighty impressive) and not through the laptop's bluetooth. Now this means two things- 1. You have to carry around the usb dongle with you everywhere you go, which means if you happen to forget it at home while traveling and carry just the mouse, then the mouse is pretty much useless in that scenario. And worse still, if you happen to carry it out of station with you and bring back only the mouse and forget to pack the dongle, then you're stuck and I don't think you get only the dongle (you'll have to check that with the seller), and  then the mouse is left useless in that case. 2. Now over to  the problem I am facing, which I did not see anyone else mention in their reviews. I use a MacBook, so it doesn't have USB-C inputs, which means you must buy a connector for it to connect the dongle. I actually had already bought a connector so that was not a problem for me, but you will have to factor in the cost of the connector, which is not cheap, because you want to buy only good quality connector for your expensive MacBook. Of course that is a problem with the MacBook and not with the mouse, but consider this point. It is very important. It will NOT connect over MacBook's Bluetooth. Otherwise, it works well with the MacBook. The only caveat I found is the tracking speed on level 2 is too slow and on level 3 is too fast. You'll have to get used to that thing. It doesn't feel very natural (as the trackpad on the MacBook feels) because of that speed problem, but otherwise, the pointer flows smoothly on screen and doesn't jump around, at least with my mouse. Also, the battery door does make a noise when landing the mouse on the pad, and I feel it could have been made better. But I guess at the cost, you really can't complain too much.Overall, I think a good buy, but the compulsion of having to use it with it's own dongle is a major drawback I feel. If that doesn't bother you, then nothing else should keep you from buying this product, especially since it is one of the cheapest wireless mice out there at less than 600 bucks, which is what it cost me.",OR,Positive

Value for Money","I recently purchased the Logitech B170 Wireless Mouse and have been using it for a few months now. I have to say, I am thoroughly impressed with this mouse. First of all, the wireless feature is a game changer. No more tangled cords or limited movement due to short cord length. The 2.4 GHz wireless connectivity is strong and I have not experienced any lag or connectivity issues. The USB Nano Receiver is also a great addition. It is so small and barely noticeable when plugged into my laptop. It does not block any other USB ports, which is a common issue with other wireless mice. The receiver also has a storage compartment in the mouse, which is a convenient feature for travel.Pros: Value for moneyHandyGood connectivityCons: Scroll does not work smoothly after a few months of using",OR,Positive
