Highly Satisfied","First the quality is excellent - light weight and easy to hold. Second it has multiple languages - too useful for old people.The only thing I didn't liked is it doesn't have received call, missed call ,and dialled call are not in one option. If you want to check missed calls you need to go to separate application to see.But Nokia is Nokia - So Go For It.",OR,Positive

It was available in 5-year-old Nokia 220, 225 etcMicro USB 1.1 won't charge with USB cables connected laptop or PC.Camera, File Manager only works when you insert a memory cardNo import or export of contacts to the Memory card. Since Bluetooth is not there, exporting will be a pain",OR,Positive
