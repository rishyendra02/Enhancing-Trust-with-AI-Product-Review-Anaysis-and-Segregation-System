The best value for money wireless optical mouse that laptop users can get?","Let's get it straight. I purchased this product recently and the initial impressions are indeed impressive. Given the package was handled carefully throughout the delivery, no external damage or functional defects were visible upon unboxing the item and using it for the first time. The mouse is light weight, thus making it suitable for carrying anywhere and the design is intentionally kept compact in order to make it ergonomically better for people with a smaller sized hand. It's quite responsive but the sensitivity adjustments made by DPI button are barely noticeable. I liked the Intelligent Power Saving function where the mouse enters standby mode when not in use in order to increase battery life. You may consider using Duracell for best results. To be honest, please don't expect this mouse to last for years, especially if you travel often given the product has been already offered at a lower price. However, the durability may also vary based on your usage pattern and frequency. Overall, a value for money computer accessory one can get. If you're planning to purchase a budget friendly wireless mouse, just go for it!",OR,Neutral

The best cheapest Mouse you'd ever find","At his price point you'd only get the wired mouse which does not come with a very long and good-quality wire, those mouses are also kind of weird and the click experience is not good at all...I've been using this mouse for almost a year now and honestly I didn't expected it to be so damn good, not only it's comfortable in your hands (I have rather small hands, so maybe go for other options if you have big hands) it also does it's job pretty well, the scroll-wheel is also decent. The only downside of this mouse is that it comes without a battery, it supports AA batteries and the rechargeable ones are pretty expensive, plus if you're a heavy mouse user the battery may not last (maybe 15-20 days at most).Plus it is to be noted that my standards are pretty low since I've never used an expensive mouse, if you have, then this product will be a great-disappointment for you",OR,Negative
