Performance beast with some minor flaws",4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this phone on first sale, my requirement were raw power and good display, both are excellent in this phone.I'll post detailed experience soon.Observation so far :My previous phone is LG G8X, compared to that this phones build quality doesn't feel premium. It's ok build, you'll have to buy some good case to protect against drop. Also this doesn't have good water resistant rating.There is no Dolby or any other audio enhancement.Funtouch OS is not that refined, for example*If you rotate your phone when auto rotation is off, in my old phone I used to get a small icon to rorate manually. This doesn't has it.*If you've connected multiple blootooth devices, switching between devices not that convenient.*Lock screen and home screen customisation not that good, dark mode has only dark black but i prefer light grey and so on.I think they can add such small but must features via software updates.Some of things I love-*If you've bought this phone, please try rhythmatic vibration for Incoming calls and alarms, it's really cool. Although haptic feedback could've been better.*Performance is really good, opening and closing apps are really fast and animation are smooth(which you can customise).*Games run in high frame rates with no hiccups. Even in hot drops.( I've tried BGMI, COD, New state many others)*Screen is bright,crip, colours are punchy and refresh rate is buttery smooth. Bezels are narrow and almost uniform which is aesthetically pleasing.* Battery backup is pretty good, on top of that charging is crazy fast. Which componsates wireless charging. (Within 20-30 min 100%)* IR blaster :)Some of the things I don't like -* Main camera takes decent photos, stabilization is not that good.(If you have time and know how to edit photos ,you can fully utilise main camera capabilities in manual mode.)My 4 year old LG takes far better photos.*Ultra wide is very bad. It should've been atleast 13MP sensor.*Videos are not that good.*Front camera is also not good. It's below average.*NFC is missing.",OR,Neutral
