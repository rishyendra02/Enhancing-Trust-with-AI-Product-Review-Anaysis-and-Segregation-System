BEST VALUE FOR MONEY 5G PHONE UNDER 25K",5.0 out of 5 stars,"After using this phn for past 3 months, I am writing this long time rivew, If you want to buy any phn Under 25K segment there is many option now , there is Moto edge 40Neo , Oneplus Nord CE3 , Realme 11 pro which are decent phones with 1 or 2 cons , It is upto you what is your top 3 preference, for me its Display ,Camera and Processor ,  Now coming to Iqoo Z7 pro , lets count it pros -1. Display :- 6.78 inch beautiful Curved AMOLED 120Hz with 1300 nits peak brightness , Screen is very bright , punchy AMOLED colors , Smooth animation  , fast UI , and no lagging or frame drop in my usage, also  HDR Supported in Youtube Netflix ,Amazon everywhere .Moto Edge 40 Neo has also similar Curved AMOLED with small screen size of 6.55 inches , supports 144Hz and 1300 nits peak brightness with a punchy color science, and HDR only supported in YouTube,  not in Netflix or amazon both Oneplus and Realme have peak brightness of only 900 nits and 950 nits respectively , which can be a issue in direct sunlight use , Nord CE 3 is flat AMOLED , not curved2. Camera : Usually I don't believe in megapixels and numbers , you need a good Rear main camera (64MP OIS) and good front camera (16MP) , which it has , Z7 pro will give you very balanced picture with attractive Social media ready pictures and Best PORTRAIT mode pictures and Best NIGHT Mode pictures in this price range,  yes Ultrawide camera is missing , but what will you do with those useless 8MP and 2 MP secondary cameras, if the main camera is not upto the mark , this phone is for my wife , she liked the Front camera also very much .If you love to shoot on Ultrawide camera then go for Edge 40 Neo or Nord CE 3 , Edge 40 neo rear camera is very very over saturated punchy colors , not everyone cup of tea , oneplus camera is also not very eye-catching, Portrait mode edge detection not perfect in any phone except Iqoo, very average camera quality in Oneplus, Megapixel is not everything you can realize after seeing that 100MP main camera in realme, it's very average , for Video every phone has max support upto 4K 30fps with OIS which helps in stable footage, here also Iqoo has the balanced output  , Moto has that punchy Saturated colour science, every phone Front camera video support max to 1080p except Edge 40 neo which support 4K30fps , so choose accordingly.3. Processor - Dimensity 7200 is a very fast processor (very near of Snapdragon 888 and Snapdragon 870)  based on Mediatek's 4nm fabrication , which helps not only in Powerful gaming but also in battery consumption, for gamers I will recommend to watch youtube reviews before purchasing , because I did not tested any game,  but for my Moderate to heavy use, i never faced any stuttering or heating or lagging , phone is very smooth , fast and responsive with 120Hz always enabled , if you keep refresh rate to auto switch then also it is very smooth. this processor keeps the phone very cool for its Liquid Cooling Vapour chamber.4. Battery & Charging :- Yes, many people including me has hesitated for 4600mAh , but what a tremendous battery Optimization in this phone ,it will easily beat all the 5000mAh phones in this price range, maybe because of DM 7200 and it's 4nm process ,  In battery backup it will easily last for 1 day ( 7-8 hours screen on time) in my moderate to heavy use, if you are light normal user than 1.5 day (9-10 hrs SOT) makes it easily better than the any other phones in this price segment ,66W fast charging is also enough for me , I know many people will be looking for more fast charging , but they don't know that fast charging actually harming your phone's battery health. so 66W charging is enough for your phone, It takes 45-50 min to full charge, which is acceptable .5. Service Center - Many of you already know Iqoo is sub brand of Vivo and it uses all 650+ Vivo service centers all across the country, so after sale services of all Iqoo phones is also very good , I already checked some youtuber all brand service centers  reviews , and Vivo Iqoo is always good in thatNow coming to cons, it is neatpicking as cons are very subjective for anyone, it is not a very big issue for everyone ,1.  Ultrawide camera :- If you use Ultrawide camera very much, very frequently then you should avoid this phn , but in this price range most of the phone offers  8MP Ultrawide camera (except Edge 40 Neo 13MP which is also average ,) with inconsistent pictures ,very inaccurate colors , picture will be not sharp , average picture quality, ultrawide camera doesn't offer 4K video recording etc etc..2. Sound :- It has Mono Speaker which is obviously loud and crystal clear , for those who use phone without headphone or earbuds,  Dual speaker is very important nowadays , for me who didn't use dual speaker phone earlier , it is not a big deal , actually I liked this phone speaker as compared to my previous phn, Most of the time i use headphone with my phone , and i don't prefer to disturb others with loud sound of my phone , Edge 40 Neo has best Speaker quality , and Both Oneplus and Realme has dual speaker which has decent output.3. OS :- Funtouch OS 13 is very improved and stable now as compared last 3-4yrs back , but has many bloatwares (which can be uninstalled), Hot apps and Hot games  (which can be diasbled) , one need to turn off the notification of all vivo browser Iqoo services otherwise it can be annoying , but as per twiter and youtube Funtouch OS 14 will come in this phone in next month, which will be bloatware free and will be buttery smooth animation and fast UI experience . Accodring to me my UI Preference will be OxygenOS > MyUX (Moto) > FuntouchOS (for its customization and smooth UI) > RealmeUI (comes with most ad & Bloatwares)Verdict : - As of now no other phone launches in this price category which is very ahead of this phone , Oneplus Nord CE 3 will be 2nd best choice for me , overall a decent phn in this category but i was looking for Curved AMOLED and best Camera quality which this phn lacks, Edge 40 Neo has very mixed reviews with heating issue and battery issue and  so saturated camera output which is not my taste, Realme is a okay okay phone , Good Display but average camera and average performance with ticking all the boxes but a average phn which is not coming top in any department.",OR,Neutral

A good money for value phone for 24k",4.0 out of 5 stars,"It's been 3 weeks since I bought this phone and I am loving it. Had many doubts while buying the phone like whether the battery life will be decent, audio output, performance etc. But after buying the phone and using it, I fall in love with it.Surprisingly this phone's battery is good, thanks to 4nm chipset. I play games like Bgmi, clash of clans, etc still it give one day battery backup. But if the phone had a 5000 mah battery it will have been a killer phone in this price range.Performance wise, according to the price the phone delivers a very good gaming experience thanks to its well optimised 7200 dimensity processor.The phone provides a smooth 60fps game play in bgmi, no lag, gives decent frames per second. Iqoo never compromise on gaming.In hand feel, display etc are exceptional. It give you a feel of holding a flag ship phone. If you are going for this phone but the Blue lagoon varient.., you will thank me later. The design is mind blowing. Attention seeker.It's super thin body and curve display gives you the  premium fell factor. The phone size is perfect. From my point of view this is a decent size phone. You don't need a more bigger phone, trust me.Camera department is good, I don't know much about camera but I can assure you that it's perfect for my use. The aura light is just mind blowing.The only one down grade is the bottom firing mono speaker,in this price rage every phone comes with duel speaker, but.....The audio quality is good, so no worries.The 4nm chipset just make the phone so unique, this chipset is mostly available in 30k area.So to rap it up, it a good all round phone in 24-25k price range. If you are looking for a new alround value for money phone I will say go for ""IQOO Z7 PRO""",OR,Neutral

The Front  Camera is not that good in comparison to the competition.3. Speakers are not Stereo, not even a single speaker is loud enough to make the difference.4. Vivo/IQOO is giving any sort of accessories on their website, Moto is giving nice hard case , user should have ample options for covers.",OR,Neutral

A good device with less compromises",4.0 out of 5 stars,"After using the device for exactly 7 days here's  what I found -Starting first with the design and build quality, the device is quite the looker. It's very thin and lightweight and the curved edges make it very comfortable to hold on for longer periods.Also the glass sandwich built feels premium.Next coming to display, the 120 hz curved amoled panel is in one word, splendid. It offers an immersive viewing experience with buttery smooth output. It also supports up to 1300 nits of peak brightness which helps viewing in direct sunlight.Now, when you buy a IQOO device you don't have to worry about the performance. It shares the typical IQOO dna and is powered by MediaTek dimensity 7200. The processor is very capable in running daily tasks and graphic intensive games. I am not much of a hardcore gamer but so far what I have tested I'm impressed. Games like BGMI, COD, Genshin Impact runs smoothly in this device with good graphic settings. IQOO also has done a job in cooling the processor, it barely gets hot while gaming.Next coming to camera, it has a 64 megapixel rear sensor which offers very good photos in daylight as well as night time. And the 16 megapixel front sensor is good too. The rear sensor can do 4k 30fps video recording and the front is locked at 1080p 30fps. Now, I am not that much of a camera guy, watching a camera review of this device will surely give you a better idea.After that I would like to share my thoughts on the battery and charging department. I was a little concerned about the 4600mah battery capacity and the 120hz display combo but surprisingly the battery holds up pretty well. I get easily a whole day of usage with 6-7 hours of screen on time which also includes gaming. The 66w charging adaptor charges the device from 0 to 100 in about 55 minutes which I believe is pretty good.Coming to network and connectivity, I haven't really got the opportunity to test the 5G connectivity as my local area does no not have 5G network. But 4G plus career aggregation is very constant and it offers good uploading and downloading speeds.The last thing to talk is about software. The device comes with the latest Funtouch OS 13 based on Android 13 and IQOO has promised 2 years of OS and 3 years of security patches which is decent.Personally I don't like the Funtouch OS much. I am coming from OneUI and compared to that this OS feels a little bit less lively. The animations are fluid and it also has all the necessary features but it needs more polishing. Do note I haven't faced any bugs in the software but there are a few advertisements which you can turn off and then it becomes a  very clean experience. The software experience completely varies from user to user so you might not be bothered by it at well. I just hope the brand polishes their UI more.Coming to compromises, it only has three which in my case is not much of an issue. It has an avarage vibration motor which doesn't offer flagship like experience. This device comes with a mono speaker which is decent. I'm coming from a device with a single speaker so it doesn't bother me as such. Also instead of the 2mp macro sensor a telephoto or ultrawide angle lens would have been highly appreciated.In conclusion, it can be said that it is a very good overall package if you can get it at 22k with the card offers. But for 24k it could've been better. It misses a few corners which would have made it perfect under 25k. I hope this review helps you to take a better purchasing decision.",OR,Neutral

One of the best midrangers out there!",4.0 out of 5 stars,"This phone has the decent specs and really promises a lot. Although it has been able to keep up it's promises to this day of my usage. The IQOO Z7 pro is an ideally priced midrange smartphone with head turning specs. Unlike the other phones, this phone keeps up it's promises. I recently updated the phone to Android 14 and it's running pretty smooth. The only con is some minor bloatware in the software which IQOO should try to eradicate in their future smartphones. Expect this, the phone is a perfect choice for all the ones who are looking for a very decent phone under 25k.",OR,Neutral

Sleek and beautiful",4.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased iQOO 2 weeks back. The phone is sleek and beautiful. While using the camera in video mode we realised that the stabilisation is not working at all. We checked all the settings but still it was shaky. We took it to Vivo service centre and they checked and after few conversation they agreed to replace the phone. In a week's time we for the new one. The video stabilisation is perfectly working in this version. So far so good. Too early to give a detail review on any pros and Cons as it's a normal use.,OR,Neutral
