Excellent product from ptron",I made a right choice for buying this product. You should buy fusion v3 model. IT has very good attractive RGB LED lighting. The sound is louder than l expected. It also nice base. And it has compact design and weight. It can use on party and it makes joyful. This is valuable for money and I bought at price of 1299/-. But it has only one con that is the mic and poor build quality of it's remote. This product is liked by people who will use it has DJ in party. we should buy a separate mic. Buy this product.,OR,Neutral
