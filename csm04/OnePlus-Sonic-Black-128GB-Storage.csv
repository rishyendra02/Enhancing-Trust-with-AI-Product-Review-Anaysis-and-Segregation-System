For 40K I would want a fast and durable device - This is it","After having OnePlus 1 original, OnePlus 3T, OnePlus 5T and OnePlus 7T, I never thought I'll get another OnePlus. Let's be honest, OnePlus 6T was the last best camera phone, and OnePlus 7T was the last overall great phone at that time.But suddenly again I got interested in 11. But the budget is just too extreme. So thought as usual maybe will give 11R a try. Already knew the issues with 11 were not in 11R.So bought it. Made a mistake last time getting 8GB, so went for 16GB. Got a blazing fast phone, with a few issues -1. The 100W charger heats up the phone like a toaster. I'm so using the old 7T charger for this phone.2. Weird sounds in WhatsApp. The mic noise cancellation doesn't work well in speakerMode.3. Camera color reproduction is a concern, but overall I love the camera.4. Hate the carved screen, I mean I literally hate it. It makes the side of the phone weird way or colours while watching content. Not to mention the occasional slip in the games. But you get used to it. The color on the screen are great though.5. Still can't find a proper screen guard since all of them have to be with UV glue, which no wonder is not good for your phone. Specially if you're using the 100W charger.But all of the cons are overshadowed by the fact that this phone is durable. Had to travel in a upper birth in train, and my phone feel flat to the ground from that height. I'm not joking, not a single scratch. The phone fell even camera side down. Agreed the spigen cover saved it a bit, but from that height, it was wow.I've decided to leave a 5 star since this device deserves it.",OR,Neutral

Recommended at 40k",Love the phone. Display is awesome. Ui feels smooth and snappy. But while playing pubg if I get a call the phone lags a bit. Battery performance is decent. Charging is fast. Camera quality is average. Main sensor takes good photos but ultra wide and macro camera performance is not good as per price. Overall a value for money phone under 40k.  OnePlus is also providing lifetime screen replacement so you can trust the brand.,CG,Neutral

Lovely!","I was using Iphone 12 previously. I had no issues with it though I needed a new phone. Ios feels ok but there is so much less in features and app support compared to the Android. Out of all I chose this phone and I am glad.Honest comparison from ios user,I just love stock UI❤️,clean that's it. No bloatwares and snappy experience.Looks of the phone are good , the black one looks pretty classic and stealthy. Glass body is easy to clean though catches more dust and debree than an Iphone. Though it is definitely a head turner. Dimensions are ok to hold with one hand too. Display is crisp, haven't noticed any difference in viewing quality.Processor is on the tops. Not to ignore 8gen 1 is itself a pretty power hungry chip so people complaining of low battery life. It is how it is. Talking about battery drain. I noticed standy drains more than when you're using scrolling though feeds , watching videos. Lasts like a whole day and Im still left with 30 plus on the device.Charging speeds have blown my mind🤯. 32 watt on IP12 is good but 100watts damn , 20 mins full charged.Camera!This is my honest review.  It does have a punch. Portraits can somewhat beat the iphones  or just color saturation is a bit more as iphone gives natural photos and different processing here. AI is pretty good for camera post processing though the video stabilization could have been better.Ultra wide lens and depth control are powerful enough, pictures do have a volume in it and can give somewhat appreciable and posts (tweets/pics) professional clicks if handled right. I have not got a chance to click much but I believe.Ps : pictures taken from iphone looks way much better on this device. More realistic, more accurate. I think this is vice versa picture looks great even on iphone clicked with OnePlus .Won't let you down 8 out of 10 times for sure. I loved it to be honest.Powerful, handy, device with zero to none laga or stuck. This is definitely one of the best phone as of now in the price point.Oneplus Yes!",OR,Neutral

Worth it for the price","I'm using the phone for a week now, so far it's impressive. Battery backup is good as well with fast charging 100W. Overall a worth product for the price.Only drawback I observed is, the face id authentication is not equipped with infrared sensor which will make face id auth at night light a difficult one.Other than this, the product is worth to go for!!!",OR,Neutral
