Watch strap not reliable","The media could not be loaded.
                



 The watch strap quality is very bad and its lock is very delicate, I have hardly worn the watch 3 to 4 times and the strap lock got spoilt. After visiting the service centre they are saying strap is not covered in Warranty and the missing part of the strap lock was not available and they advised to replace the full strap costing 1600 rupees. Very pathetic after sales service so would advice not to buy such product which have such delicate parts and which are not covered in Warranty. Seriously I am very disappointed.",OR,Positive
