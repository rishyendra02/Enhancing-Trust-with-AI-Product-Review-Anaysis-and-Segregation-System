# Enhancing-Trust-with-AI-Product-Review-Analysis-and-Segregation-System



## Problem Statement
When it comes to online shopping, it can be difficult to tell the difference between real and fake product ratings. All of us rely on reviews and star ratings, but some of them can be bias or fraudulent. Sorting through reviews to find the reliable ones will help us solve this mystery. Both buyers and sellers should take note of this. Trust in the online marketplace is increased by this work, which is advantageous to all parties.

## Features 

* **Sentiment Analysis**: Utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the sentiment of product reviews, categorizing them as positive, negative, or neutral.

* **Aspect Extraction**: Identifies key aspects or features mentioned in the reviews, such as product quality, pricing, customer service, etc.

* **Review Segregation**: Segregates reviews based on their sentiment and identified aspects, providing a structured view of customer feedback.

* **Interactive Visualization**: Generates interactive visualizations to present the analysis results in an intuitive and user-friendly manner.

* **Scalability**: Designed to handle a large volume of reviews efficiently, allowing for scalability as the system grows.
